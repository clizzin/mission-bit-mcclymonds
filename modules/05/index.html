                          I hope making a game in HTML and CSS was a nice appetizer for the main course: making your
                          own game in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>! 
                          Here's the plan for the rest of the semester:
                        </p>  
                        <img alt="Drew Carey JS joke" style="width: 350px; float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"

                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Spend the next few weeks learning the basics of programming by making a 
                            "block dodger" game in JS. We'll work in teams and as a class.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Spend the remaining seven weeks building your own game (or web app!) in JS, working in groups.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          JS is going to be a significant increase in difficulty from HTML and CSS, but we're also
                          going to spend more time on it and ensure everyone understands the important concepts as we go.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Games can be challenging to program, so getting as solid on the basics as you can
                          is your best bet: try to spend as much time as possible on 
                          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy</a>! 
                          It's sort of like writing a short story; you want to spend time worrying about the 
                          high-level stuff like plot and character development and not on low-level stuff like 
                          spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Here's the block dodger game we're going to build together:

                          A word of caution: programming can be complex, and sometimes bits of code I'm going to show you 
                          have to be taken on faith, at least at first. These bits are generally there to get the app to 
                          function for us, but might involve a more advanced concept than you may be ready to see. Don't be intimidated--just 
                          type it in, read a brief explanation, then we'll revisit these concepts again when you'll have the context
                          and conceptual arsenal for understanding them.

                        <h2 id="js">JavaScript: the programming language of the web</h2>
                        <p>
                          JS is one of the easiest programming languages to learn,
                          but is also extremely powerful. It's the only language that runs directly in web browsers.
                          The cool thing about this is that when you visit a website which has JS, you can read it just like
                          HTML and CSS using the "view page source" feature on your browser (as discussed in 
                          <a href="../01/index.html#html">module 1</a>). It also means that JS has a monopoly on
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">front-end</a> programming, 
                          which guarantees that 1) an enormous amount of time and effort goes into making it great, and 2) it 
                          will likely be relevant for some time to come.
                        </p>

                          There is so much theory behind programming, and I love to discuss it and think about how it all works. 
                          But we don't really have time to get too detailed, unfortunately, so I'll leave it to you to pursue
                          your own research as you feel inclined. If I get too off-topic, just tell me to get back on track!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Oh yeah: you may have heard of this "Java" thing:
                        </p>
                        <img alt="JS !== Java"

                        <p>
                          That's true to a large extent; however, once you learn a programming language, all of the basics 
                          transfer to any other language, so in that sense Java and JS are not all that different. Language choice
                          boils down to picking the right tool for the job, and for front-end web programming, JS is the only tool.
                        </p>  
                        <hr style="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="hello-world">Hello, world!</h2>
                        <p>
                          With that introduction, let's dive in to doing programming in JS. The first orders of business are 
                          making sure JS is working and getting comfortable with our development environment(s).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello, world!</a> is the 
                          first program you'll write in any language, so let's go ahead and write it:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello, world!");</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          This program tells JS to print the text "Hello, world!" in the browser's console.
                          Let's execute this program at <a href="https://repl.it/languages/javascript">repl.it</a>. 
                          Repl is an easy way to run snippets of JS code, so we'll be using it often. Once you've run 
                          the program, try changing the text inside the quotation marks, and run it again. Tip: whenever
                          you have some new code, always try making a change or three to convince yourself of how it works.
                        </p>
                        <hr style="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="developer-tools">Developer tools</h2>
                        <p>
                          Now that we have a working JS program, let's run it in a few different environments
                          and learn about our browser's developer tools. Developer tools are included in
                          every major browser, but opening them is platform- and browser- specific; ask 
                          <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> "how do i open developer tools in 
                          <i>os x</i> and <i>browser y</i>?" where <i>x</i> is your operating system (Mac/Windows)
                          and <i>y</i> is your browser (Chrome, Firefox). In particular, we'll be using the console component of
                          the dev tools, which is a place that can interactively execute JS code, display errors, 
                          and show output from <code>console.log()</code> statements.
                        </p>
                        <img alt="Chrome/Mac console path image" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ktv4E.png">
                        <p>
                          With your console open, try running the "Hello, world!" program by typing it right into the console.
                          Once that works, also try running the program on <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. 
                          The output will be visible in the browser's console as well as Codepen's mini-console.
                        </p>  
                        <hr styel="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="local-development">Local development</h2>
                        <p>
                          Now that we know how to make JS output something in the browser, let's turn our attention to
                          running JS code inside an HTML file.  As with CSS, we can include JS in a HTML file in a few ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>inside of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags</li>
                          <li>as an external <code>.js</code> script file</li>
                          <li>in-line, inside of an HTML element</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          We'll be using external <code>.js</code> files mostly, and here's how:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Create two files in the same directory: <code>greeting.html</code> and <code>greeting.js</code>.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Inside of <code>greeting.js</code>, add the following JS code (it uses new syntax which I'll explain shortly):
<pre><code class="javascript">// Ask the user for their name
let visitorName = prompt("What is your name?");

// Greet the user
alert("Hello, " + visitorName + "!");</code></pre>
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Inside of <code>greeting.html</code>, add the following code, which includes the JS
                              script in the HTML code; the script executes when the page is loaded:
                            </p>  
<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Greeting page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src="greeting.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Open <code>greeting.html</code> in a browser and enter your name into the prompt. 
                              Consider yourself greeted. 
                            </p>
                          </li>  
                        </ol>  
                        <p>
                          If you wish, feel free to try writing this same program on <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>.
                          Codepen fills in the basic <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                          tags automatically and connects the three scripts together, so all you have to write is the JS code.
                          Same thing on <a href="https://repl.it/languages/javascript">repl.it</a>--just the JS is enough.

                        <p>
                          Cool. Now that you've executed a couple of programs in a variety of environments, let's take a moment
                          to examine how the "greeting" program works, then we'll call it a day. Let's start with the first two
                          lines:
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="javascript">// Ask the user for their name
let visitorName = prompt("What is your name?");</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          The first line is a comment, but with a slightly different syntax from the CSS comments. CSS
                          comments work in JS too; they're called multi-line comments, while the <code>//</code> comment
                          is a single-line comment.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          The second line has a lot of action in it. Let's start with <code>prompt("What is your name?");</code>.
                          This line calls a <i><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_functions.htm">function</a></i> 
                          that was built into the standard JS library. Functions are bits of code that serve a single, explicit
                          purpose and can be <i>called</i>, or executed, again and again. The <code class="javascript">prompt</code> function makes
                          a dialog box pop up and waits for the user to input text and press "OK."
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Two cool things about functions which are on display in the above example:
                        </p>  
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              You can specify <i>parameters</i> which go inside the <code class="js">( )</code> 
                              parenthesis after the function name. Parameters change how the function behaves during a call. 
                              In this case, <code class="js">prompt()</code> allows the programmer to tell it which 
                              <i>string</i>, or bit of text, it should display in the dialog box. Try changing the 
                              <code class="js">"What is your name?"</code> line to something else
                              and see what happens. Just make sure to keep the quotes. Can you identify the parameter
                              for <code class="js">console.log("Hello, world!");</code>?
                            </p>
                          </li>  
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Functions can <i>return</i> information from them when they are called. In this case, the function
                              returns a string, which is whatever the user entered into the dialog box.
                            </p>

                              src="https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/500x/69412000/yo-dawg-i-heard-you-like-functions-so-i-put-a-function-in-your-function-so-you-can-call-functions-wh.jpg" />
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                          Now that the <code class="javascript">prompt("What is your name?");</code> 
                          component is a little clearer, let's discuss the <code class="javascript">let visitorName =</code> 
                          part. <code class="javascript">let</code> is a keyword in JS which creates a new
                          <i><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_variables.htm">variable</a></i>, or
                          named storage space for a piece of data. We can store anything in this variable and retrieve and manipulate it
                          later on in our program. We can name the variable any series of letters, numbers, or underscores we want, provided
                          that it doesn't begin with a number. There are some conventions for naming variables in JS. For now,
                          write all variable names in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camelCase</a>--the 
                          first word is lowercase and all subsequent words begin with an uppercase letter.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Another thing to note is that <code class="javascript">var</code> is another way 
                          to declare a variable which you may see used, and you are welcome to use yourself 
                          instead of <code class="javascript">let</code>. The difference is too small to worry
                          about just yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As for the <code class="javascript">=</code> equals sign, this isn't a measure of equality, but rather an 
                          <i>assignment operator</i>. Assignment takes the value on the right of the 
                          <code class="javascript">=</code> and sticks it into the variable on the left. 
                          If I run the program and type "bob" into the prompt, that string gets
                          stored in the <code class="javascript">visitorName</code> variable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          OK, it's all smooth sailing for the next bit of code:
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="javascript">// Greet the user
alert("Hello, " + visitorName + "!");</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Here's another JS built-in function called <code class="javascript">alert()</code>, which is the annoying 
                          pop-up box you've probably encountered before. You (hopefully) won't be using 
                          <code class="javascript">prompt()</code> and <code class="javascript">alert()</code> much, 
                          but they're handy for little test code like this. <code class="javascript">alert()</code> works
                          by taking a string parameter and makes that the text that pops up. It doesn't return any value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The more interesting part of the second line of code is what's going on inside the function's
                          parameter. The <code class="javascript">+</code> symbols are <i>concatenating</i>, or joining, 
                          the values of three strings, "Hello, ", "bob", and "!" into one string: "Hello, bob!" (assuming 
                          the user entered "bob" into the prompt), which is what gets sent into the 
                          <code class="javascript">alert()</code> function for display.
                        </p>
                        <hr style="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="done">Done!</h2>
                        <p>
                          Great! You learned a <b>ton</b> about JS today. Let it all sink in, play with the greeting program, and work on 
                          basics at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">Codecademy</a>. A lot of programming
                          stuff won't make sense at first, but stick with it and it'll become second nature. See you 
                          <a href="../06/">next time</a>, when we'll begin working with graphics and start on our block dodger game!
