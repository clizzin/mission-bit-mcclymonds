                          I hope all of your pages are coming along smoothly! I'm sure you're eager to spice up
                          your designs to look cooler than plain HTML, though.

                          (Cascading Style Sheets) is the tool to take care of that.

                          CSS is easy to pick up and can do very cool stuff off the bat. However, there is a 
                          great deal of depth to CSS as well. Due to the brevity of this course
                          and its focus on game rather than visual design, we'll only touch the absolute basics of 
                          CSS. I highly recommend exploring it further on your own!

                        <h2 id="css-selectors">CSS selectors</h2>
                        <p>
                          CSS works by <i>selecting</i> elements from an HTML document 
                          and adding properties to these elements. What are "elements?" Well, whenever you create a 
                          set of tags, like <code>&lt;p&gt;this paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>, the browser creates an 
                          element behind the scenes which can be manipulated by CSS (and, later, JavaScript).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The properties CSS allows you to modify range from size to color to positioning 
                          and to animation. I can only discuss a few basic properties; check w3schools' 
                          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/">CSS reference</a> for a list
                          of properties you can add to HTML elements and go crazy experimenting.

                        <p>
                          CSS selectors can be placed in one of three ways:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>in a separate <code>.css</code> file</li>
                          <li>inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of an HTML document</li>
                          <li>as an in-line attribute, right inside an HTML tag</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                          You're welcome to do whichever you
                          want, but the most powerful method is the external file because you only need to make one
                          <code>.css</code> file for your whole project, so that's what I'll focus on here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Here's how to make your first stylesheet:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Create a new file in the same folder as your <code>index.html</code> file 
                              called <code>main.css</code>.
                            </p>  
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Inside of <code>main.css</code>, write your first CSS selector:
                            </p>
<pre><code class="css">p {
  color: red;
}</code></pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Save <code>main.css</code>, and head back to editing your <code>index.html</code> file.
                              Add the following element inside of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags. This loads the 
                              CSS file and applies its selectors to the HTML document. You can reference the same
                              stylesheet from as many HTML files as you want:
                            </p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href=""&gt;</code></pre>
                          </li>  
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                          And you're done! Open your <code>index.html</code> file in a browser and you should see 
                          all of your paragraphs have a <span style="color: red;">red</span> font color. 
                          In your <code>main.css</code> file, try changing <code>p</code> to <code>a</code>.
                          Refresh the website and see how the results change. Feel free to add as many selectors
                          as you like, and experiment with different properties. 
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="comments">Comments: your #1 pal</h2>
                        <p>
                          I also need to introduce comments, one of the most important parts of coding. Comments
                          are mini explanations inside your code which maintain readability for yourself and your teammates.
                          Here's a little example stylesheet, with comments, to whet your appetite for experimenting
                          with different CSS properties:
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="css">/* The asterisk selector means "select all elements" */
* {
  font-family: "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}

/* The body selector is a good place to add wallpaper */
body {
  background: url("https://cdn.tutsplus.com/psd/uploads/legacy/001_WebDesignWeek/02_Layout/pattern_14.jpg");
}

a {
  color: #41a6d8;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* :hover is a "pseudoselector" that becomes active 
 * whenever the mouse is in the element */
a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

/* border is a somewhat more complex property, taking a 
 * size, a style, and a color separated by spaces */
p {
  border: 1px solid #000000;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Note that colors are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> format. 
                          I recommend using a 
                          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool">color picker tool</a>
                          to generate these hexadecimal values and paste them into your stylesheet.
                        </p>
                        <hr style="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="classes-ids">CSS classes and IDs</h2>
                        <p> 
                          OK, so you now know how to apply CSS styles to <i>all</i> elements of a tag with a selector. But let's say
                          you want to apply style to only a <i>specific</i> paragraph rather than all of your paragraphs at once, or
                          want to create a single selector that you can apply to, say, paragraph, header, and anchor elements 
                          all at once.  To do this, CSS provides classes and IDs, two powerful tools that work in similar ways. 
                          The only difference between the two is that you never have more than one element set to a given ID, but 
                          have as many elements sharing a class as you want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In your CSS file, the syntax for making a class or ID is easy: simply make up any word you want and
                          prefix it with a <code>#</code> to denote an ID and a <code>.</code> to denote a class.
                        </p>
<pre><code class="css">/* A class that centers text */
.center-text {
  text-align: center;
}

/* An id for styling a particular huge button */
#huge-button {
  font-size: 40px;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          With IDs and classes under your belt, most deployment of CSS in HTML boils down to two 
                          tags, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, which do nothing on their 
                          own but act as generic elements to add CSS classes and IDs to. There is only one difference 
                          between these tags: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> creates a line break and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 
                          doesn't. Let's deploy the selectors we just made in a sample HTML file. I'll add CSS to the 
                          header for brevity's sake. Note the <code>class=""</code> and <code>id=""</code> attributes:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      .center-text {
        text-align: center;
      }
      
      #huge-button {
        font-size: 40px;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;    
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="center-text"&gt;
      &lt;button id="huge-button"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Last bit on IDs and classes: you can add as many classes to an element as you wish 
                          (separate each class name with a space), and you can combine an ID and classes on the same
                          element. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Until a tool called <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>
                          was added to CSS a couple years ago, centering items was pretty difficult. Flexbox is 
                          a fairly technical layout tool, so I'll only show you how to use it for centering purposes,
                          for example, if you'd like to put content smack in the middle of the screen:
                        </p>
                        <p data-height="379" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="dzddVj" data-default-tab="css,result" 
                          data-user="ggorlen" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="flex centering" class="codepen">See the Pen

                        <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                        <p>
                          I won't bog you down with too much of an explanation here--just apply the <code>.main</code> 
                          class to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and any elements inside of it will be centered
                          on both axes. The code inside of the <code>body</code> selector ensures that
                          that container expands to fill the screen. <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> are CSS units 
                          representing percentage of the viewport height and width.

                          OK, that should give you *plenty* of control over your HTML page's
                          design. Go at it!
