                        <p>
                          Welcome back! When we last looked at our budding block dodger game, we had an animation 
                          of a shape moving on the screen. Humble beginnings! Before moving forward by adding more 
                          features to turn the animation into a legitimate game, it's time to do some organization 
                          that will help keep the code simple in the long haul. Programming involves a lot of this;
                          it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a>, or
                          cleaning up existing code before moving forward.
                        </p>
                        <img alt="Refactoring meme"
                          src="http://dev.solita.fi/img/when-to-refactor/not-sure-if-refactoring.jpg">
                        <p>
                          To do this, we'll use an object. As I hinted at in previous sessions, objects are collections
                          of properties and actions that are grouped together to represent something in a program. In terms of a 
                          game, the box we've rendered on screen represents a player, which has an x and y location, a size,
                          a color, and the ability to move.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In JS, objects can be created in a number of ways. For this game, we'll use a pattern that looks a bit like
                          the <code class="js">update</code> function you wrote last session, but with parameters and 
                          saved in a variable; we'll discuss other patterns as they arise:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Represents a box, defined by an x and y
// position, size, and color
let Box = function (x, y, size, color) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
  this.size = size;
  this.color = color;
};
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          And poof--we have a function that can make boxes, and we've saved it in a variable called <code class="js">Box</code> (note
                          the capital B, which is standard style to designate a constructor function in JS). 
                          It works by taking four parameters, <code class="js">x</code>, 
                          <code class="js">y</code>, <code class="js">size</code>, and <code class="js">color</code> and assigns
                          them to variables that begin with <code class="js">this.</code>. <code class="js">this.</code> refers to
                          a variable of a particular object once it's been created. Forgetting to write <code class="js">this.</code>
                          has to be one of the most common mistakes in JS. Let's see how this works by 
                          integrating the constructor function into the main script and making a new box using the <code class="js">new</code>
                          keyword. Once that's done, we can now refer to the <code class="player">player</code> object's 
                          <code class="js">x</code> and <code class="js">y</code>
                          properties. Lastly, while I'm at it, I'll position the player at the bottom of the screen using
                          the <code class="js">canvas</code> object's <code class="js">height</code> and <code class="width">width</code>
                          properties (but feel free to play with the numbers):
                        </p>
                        <p data-height="713" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MvGWRV" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="ggorlen" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="block dodger (part 3)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ggorlen/pen/MvGWRV/">block dodger (part 3)</a> by ggorlen (<a href="https://codepen.io/ggorlen">@ggorlen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                        <p>
                          Don't worry if this isn't all clear yet--we'll be making many more objects, so the purpose of 
                          going through all this trouble to get essentially the same result will be clear as our program
                          grows.
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 id="mouse-input">Adding mouse input</h2>
                        <p>
                          Last session, we added movement to the box, updating its x and y 
                          position on every frame until it left the screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          However, we can't consider this box truly a representation of the 
                          person playing the game until we offer the user the ability to control it.
                          The two common inputs are keyboard and mouse; touch is another input
                          that JS supports for compatibility with mobile devices (we'll save mobile development
                          for another course).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For this game, let's try mouse input--it's a little bit simpler to 
                          implement than keyboard, but not by much.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To add user interaction in JS, we attach an <i>event listener</i> to an HTML element or 
                          to the entire webpage.  The event listener function has two parameters: a type of event to listen for
                          and a function to execute when the specified event occurs. Here's what our listener will
                          look like:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// A variable to keep track of the x coordinate of the mouse
let mouseX = 0;

// Listen for mouse movements
document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
  mouseX = e.pageX - canvas.getBoundingClientRect().left;
});
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Personally, the first time I saw this, it just messed my head up. Sending a function into a function?
                          That's insane. However, try thinking of it like this and it should be easier to follow:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <i>(Talking to the </i><code class="js">addEventListener()</code><i> function)</i> "Hey 
                          <code class="js">addEventListener</code>, please wait for the <code class="js">mousemove</code> event, 
                          then whenever that happens, execute this other function I'm giving you."
                        </p>
                          <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*exgznl7z65gttRxLsMAV2A.png" 
                            alt="functional programming meme">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This event listener uses a little bit of positioning math to establish the mouse's actual location
                          unadultered by the flexbox centering. A more comprehensive example of listeners (with keyboard!)
                          is available <a href="../../code/eventlisteners/">here</a>. But don't sweat the details here; this 
                          is an advanced concept which we'll revisit this later on! The important part is that whenever the mouse
                          moves, the <code class="js">mouseX</code> variable will be updated to contain the mouse's current
                          X position along the horizontal axis. Try adding <code class="js">console.log(mouseX);</code>
                          just after the <code class="js">mouseX =</code> line and watch the value change as you move your
                          mouse around!
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 id="moving">Adding a move function to the box</h2>
                        <p>
                          Now that we have a variable representing the mouse position, let's add a function to the Box
                          class that will enable it to follow the mouse:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Updates the position of the box
Box.prototype.move = function (x) {
  
  // Move to the parameter x position
  this.x = x;
};</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Here's some new syntax: <code class="js">Box.prototype.move</code>, which attaches a new function
                          called <code class="js">move</code> to the Box object prototype. In other words, this function 
                          definition will belong to all Box objects. I can go to any box and call <code class="js">box.move()</code>
                          and the code in the function will be executed. As we'll see in the next couple of classes,
                          it's very handy to write one function that will be shared among dozens of objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We also need to call this function for it to do anything. Let's wonder out loud: how often
                          do we want to move the player box? If the answer is "every frame," then we call 
                          <code class="js">player.move()</code> inside the <code class="js"> update()</code> 
                          function, which is responsible for updating the game state and redrawing stuff. We'll
                          send in the <code class="js">mouseX</code> variable, which contains the mouse's x position,
                          as a parameter. Let's put it all together and see what we've got:
                        </p>

<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                        <p>
                          There are a couple glaring issues here, to my mind. Let's fix them in the next section.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="improvement">Improving the box movement with easing and conditionals</h2>
                        <p>
                          The first issue is that the box follows the mouse, but the movement is unsatisfying 
                          from a gameplay standpoint. Let's simulate realistic movement with a technique called 
                          easing, which involves a little basic arithmetic:
                        </p>
                        
<pre><code class="js">// Updates the position of the box
Box.prototype.move = function (x) {
  
  // Ease towards the mouse position
  this.x += (x - this.x) * 0.003;
};</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          The idea is to move the box <i>towards</i> the mouse by a tiny amount proportional to the distance 
                          between the two instead of just plopping it right on top of the mouse. As always, try tweaking the easing amount of 
                          <code class="js">0.03</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Another problem is that the box goes right off the edge of the screen, which leads us to an important 
                          programming concept: <i>conditionals</i>. Conditionals determine which parts of a program are actually
                          executed while a program runs. The programmer decides what conditions need to be present and directs the program's
                          flow accordingly, depending on whether these conditions evaluate to true or false. In our game, we want to check
                          every frame whether any part of the box is off screen, and if so, execute some code to put it back on screen.
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="js">// Updates the position of the box
Box.prototype.move = function (x) {
  
  // Ease towards the mouse position
  this.x += (x - this.x) * 0.05;
  
  // Make sure the box can't go off the screen
  if (this.x + this.size &gt; canvas.width) {
    this.x = canvas.width - this.size;
  }
  else if (this.x &lt; 0) {
    this.x = 0;
  }
};</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          There's a little math going on here, so feel free to play around with the logic and numbers and 
                          then restore the code when you've convinced yourself of how it works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Let's put everything from this module together:

                          Well, that was a heap of information to take in! Again, don't worry if it doesn't stick on first contact;
                          this stuff is dense! Read through a few times and play with the concepts you're learning as much as possible.
                          The nice thing is that these basic patterns and concepts are so fundamental, you'll encounter them in nearly
                          every program you'll write, so they're well worth the energy investment, I promise. Stick with it!
