                          Let's get to know each other. Form a circle and respond to the following:
                        </p>  
                        <ol>
                          <li>Name</li>

                          <li>Something interesting or unique about yourself</li>

                        <p>
                          The catch is that each person to speak should state the name and interesting fact of each

                        <p>Let's form groups and discuss equity in computer science. Here are some questions to talk about:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Do you feel that you've been given an equal exposure to technology in school as other 
                              people you know? In other words, which side of the "tech divide" are you on and why?
                            </p>  
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Do you believe you could get a job in the tech industry when you graduate high school 
                              if you wanted to? Why or why not?
                            </p>  
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Do you have any concerns or fears about learning technology skills you would like to share?
                            </p>
                          </li>  
                          <li>
                            <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">Growth mindset</a> 
                            is the belief that one's abilities aren't fixed, and that through hard work and perseverence, one 
                            can improve. Please contrast this mindset with a fixed mindset, which is the belief 
                            that one's abilities are set from a young age. On the spectrum between "fixed" and "growth" mindset, 
                            where do you see yourself?
                          </li>
