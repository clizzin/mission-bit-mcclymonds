       <p>
         A common scenario: you've learned something new and unfamiliar with some guidance,
         then you're cut loose and asked to make a project! The big question is: how to move from that
         structured environment and forge ahead under your own power? This module will hopefully
         offer some guidance in that regard, but importantly, I (your instructor), your peers, and MB staff
         and volunteers will be here to keep you on track, so as long as you're engaged, you'll be just fine!
       </p>
       <p>
         Think back to the Choose Your Own Adventure game your group made at the beginning of the semester.
         First, you planned out your game, then gathered necessary skills and resources, and coded it up.
         Along the way, you may have run into a situation or two that forced you to change plans a bit, and 
         you adapted. That's pretty much the plan here, too--plan, find resources, build, repeat (as necessary). 
       </p>
       <hr>
       <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
       <p>
         Start by spending an hour or so to do intensive planning with your team.
         Some questions to ask (it's OK if you can only make a partial answer for starters):
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Do we want to make a game or web application?</li>
         <li>What is the purpose/goal of our game or application?</li>
         <li>What type of features do you want your game or app to have?</li>
         <li>What parts of the project is each group member interested in doing?</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         Your group may also benefit from a brainstorming session. An effective approach to brainstorming involves
         everyone in the group writing down as many ideas as possible for 5 minutes in silence. Do not filter your
         ideas at this stage--crazy is OK. After the idea-generating stage, the group will reconvene and discuss
         the ideas to filter out the most engaging and practical of them. Voting, using a
         process of elimination, or ranking system may be useful in this filtering stage. 
       </p>
       <img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/aa/aa84668dcca563c1956e9ace76a1e88f09347b1b5fa50cff38f88fe71ad85312.jpg"
         alt="Lil Wayne meme">
       <p>
         Once you have an idea, try to simplify the idea as much as possible. You'll always be able to add new
         features to whatever it is you make, but if the scope of your ideas is vast, it'll be much
         harder to get momentum going and feel like you're making progress.
       </p>
       <p>
         Another easy way to go about choosing a project is by doing your own version of a standard, classic
         game or app. This more or less eliminates the problem of planning right away, and your
         team can go right into finding resources and writing code. Check the <a href="../resources">resources page</a>
         to get connected with some ideas.
       </p>
       <p>
         I'd also like to speak frankly: platformers and games with heavy physics components tend to be popular,
         but these can be challenging first projects, so I try to discourage them.
         If you're set on it, warnings be damned, go for it. One way to make a successful physics-based project
         is to use a game framework, so I'll introduce one later in this module. Either way, we'll make it 
         happen, but know that platformer usually means serious coding ahead!
       </p>
       <p>
         Don't forget to use Google Docs or create a text file in your group's Github repository to organize
         your ideas, resources, and todos as you work on the project.
       </p>  
       <hr>
       <h2 id="finding-resources">Finding resources</h2>
       <p>
         Once you have a project goal, you can begin gathering resources. Are there any tutorials 
         that apply to your game or application or to something similar? What technologies will be 
         necessary? This can be a difficult task at first, since there are so many unknowns in the 
         field, but I'll help you filter your research to hone in on valuable resources. The important
         thing is working on your ability to collect, evaluate, filter, and utilize these resources; you'll be doing it
         constantly throughout your programming journey. This website's <a href="../../resources">resources</a>
         page is a good place to start exploring!
       </p>
       <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/51/d6/a551d685623508da950e55b76e2bdcfd.jpg" alt="Googling joke">
       <hr>
       <h2 id="writing-your-app">Writing your app</h2>
       <img alt="Kobe meme" style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px; float: right;"
         src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kuMj0hhXYBg/UAdploozEPI/AAAAAAAAAPU/TdlIG27er-I/s1600/3ot0c0.jpg">
       <p>
         And now, the fun part! Dive into writing your app as soon as you're confident with your plan
         and have a few basic resources on hand. Getting started is the hardest part, and the 
         <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/219455-the-secret-of-getting-ahead-is-getting-started-the-secret">
         key to getting ahead is getting started</a>. And, of course, the key to getting started is 
         breaking the large task into smaller tasks and working on the easiest one.
       </p>
       <p>
         A very important part of this process is ensuring everyone in the group is contributing!
         Remember, your group is counting on you to step up and offer to help out every day. If you're not able
         to find something to do at a given moment, head over to 
         <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy</a> to improve your JS.
         This will be helpful to your team later on. Playing games or surfing the net is going to distract
         your teammates, so schedule a time outside of class to kick it with them to do that stuff.
       </p>
       <p>
         And don't even think about procrastinating!
       </p>
       <hr style="clear: both;">
       <h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
       <p>
         All right, let's talk technically from here out. First topic: debugging. I'm sure you've encountered
         some error in your code so far--it's normal! The truth is, almost every program doesn't work at first. 
         Debugging is a huge topic and, like computer programming itself, is just as much of an art as a science.
       </p>  
       <p>
         The best way to debug is to avoid bugs in the first place. This means following clear logic,
         planning, naming variables descriptively, organizing your project's logic in clear function and classes,
         using comments, etc. Easy to say, hard to do.
       </p>
       <p>
         But when bugs inevitably do show up, they are a great opportunity to learn. The three kinds of bugs are 
         syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors. Syntax errors are generally easy to fix: the browser's console (see
         <a href="../05/index.html#developer-tools">module 5</a>) will show you the error explaining the problem 
         and the line number it occured on. Your job is to go fix it. Often, it's a simple typo, although sometimes
         it's a bit more involved, but basically it boils down to JS plain not understanding what you typed in. 
         As you know by now, every letter matters, case sensitivity matters; it's totally unlike English, where you 
         can pretty much misspell everything and folks generally know what you mean.
       </p>
       <p>
         Runtime errors are when everything is typed to the language's syntactical standards, but at some point in the program,
         the code attempts to do something that is disallowed. For example, if I pass strings into a
         function that requires number input or I attempt to access an array element that doesn't exist, the program 
         will crash. These errors can be trickier to navigate than syntax errors and require an understanding 
         of your program's state--what values the variables
         contain and what conditions are present when the error occurred. Resolving runtime errors uses techniques discussed
         below, but with the advantage of JS providing a line number where the error was thrown.
       </p>
       <img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/80/80ff000de170d180836519b11ef29b7814dc5d5b5b24abed94f5c3828075e811.jpg"
         alt="Debugging meme" style="max-width: 500px;">
       <p>
         Logic errors, on the other hand, occur when JS says your program is fine and dandy, no errors show in
         the developer console, but your program still isn't behaving as you expect. Maybe a variable you're expecting
         to have some value at some point in the code's execution doesn't have that value, or a conditional
         you expect to be true is evaluating false. Resolving these types of bugs requires a bit of detective work
         and problem-solving. These bugs are great because they force you to understand your program logic on a deeper level
         than you do, and facing them head-on will really improve your programming skills. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Some concrete strategies for resolving these logic errors include inserting <code class="js">console.log()</code>
         statements in your code and re-running your program to see if the value of variables and conditionals matches
         your expectations. Sometimes, entire blocks of code aren't even executing, and a simple 
         <code class="js">console.log("Is this even working?");</code> call in the code block in question
         will tell you a lot about your program's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a>. 
         The console also offers the ability to interactively type in a variable
         name that exists in your program's global scope (i.e. isn't inside a function) and see information about it or 
         execute test code. The console also allows breakpoints to be set (for Chrome, this feature is in the Sources tab
         under "Show debugger"). This means that your code will stop running on the line(s) you've told it to, and you can
         poke around and check variable values, conditionals, and so forth to diagnose your logic problem.
       </p>
       <p>
         All in all, debugging is a very big topic, so this is just a taste of the agony and ecstacy in store for you.
         Since this is an introductory course, as mentioned, we've got folks on hand to make these debugging procedures
         as painless and educational as possible, so let a mentor or the instructor know if something is going
         wrong, and we'll walk you through it!

       <h2 id="git">Git and terminal</h2>
       <h3>A little background</h3>
       <p>
         Last topic: using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Github</a>, 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> 
         and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command line</a>. 
         As with debugging, these are complex topics, so I'm only offering a small taste of these tools. 
         You know by now that Github can
         host your website and store your code. You may also know that each time you upload code,
         you've made something called a "commit," which is a version of a repository. Github is
         a repository host and interface for a tool called git, which is operated by typing commands on
         a text-only screen called a terminal and is the backbone of version control. This terminal, without getting too technical,
         is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>, a really old and powerful 
         operating system that Mac's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a> is built on top of. 
         All developers need to be familiar with Unix and git in addition to programming languages. 
         Staring for days on end at black screens with monospace text makes programmers feel cool (it's a pretty useful tool, too).
       </p>
       <h3>Terminal basics</h3>
       <p>
         Using a terminal, you can navigate through folders and perform actions on files just like you do with 
         your mouse. To start a terminal session on Mac, click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner and type 
         "terminal," or click on the shortcut link in your dock. When the screen appears, you'll see a prompt
         which shows your current directory (folder). Type <code class="bash">pwd</code> to see a path to your current directory. 
         You can show a list of the files in your directory by typing 
         <code class="bash">ls</code> and you can change to another folder by typing 
         <code class="bash">cd foldername</code>. If there are 
         spaces in the folder name, use quotes. Type <code class="bash">cd ..</code> to go to the folder "above" the one you're 
         currently in. Feel free to check a 
         <a href="https://diyhacking.com/linux-commands-for-beginners/">basic list of terminal commands</a> to learn
         more useful things you can do on the command line. For now, <code class="bash">pwd</code>, <code class="bash">ls</code> and 
         <code class="bash">cd</code> should be sufficient.
       </p>
       <h3>Setting up git</h3>
       <p>
         OK, now that you're comfortable moving around directories in the terminal, let's learn how to set up git on your
         computer. From a prior semester, someone else may be logged in, so you'll want to 
         change users by typing in terminal:
       </p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Bob"
$ git config --global user.email "bob@example.com"</code></pre>
       <p>
         and <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1064197/how-to-switch-git-user-at-terminal/1064244#1064244">ensuring
         that your computer's keychain hasn't saved the password automatically</a>.
       </p>
       <h3>Creating and cloning a repository</h3>
       <p>
         After you've set up your git credentials, go ahead and 
         <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">create a repository</a> for your project. Choose 
         a simple repository name; long names with unusual characters or alternating capitalization may impact
         your (and your users') ability to type it in correctly.
         It's a good idea to initialize the repository with a readme.
       </p>  
       <p>
         The next step is to get a copy of your repository to your computer. This is called 
         <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">cloning</a> and involves
         using terminal.
         <ol>
           <li>
             <p>
               Open your repository in your browser and click the green button that says "Clone or download."
             </p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>
               Copy the repository name (example: <code class="bash">https://github.com/ggorlen/mb.git</code>) to the clipboard.
             </p>
             <img alt="github cloning demo animation" src="gh-clone.gif" />
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>
               Open terminal and navigate to the folder you'd like to clone the repo to, and enter
               <code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/ggorlen/mb.git</code> (or whatever your repo name 
               is--you can paste it from your clipbboard).  Optionally, type <code class="bash">ls</code> to see 
               your freshly cloned directory.
             </p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>
               Type <code class="bash">cd your-repo-name</code> to open your new project directory and (optionally) 
               type <code class="bash">ls</code> again to see the cloned files.
             </p>
             <img alt="git clone demo animation" src="git-clone.gif" />
           </li>
         </ol>
       </p>  
       <h3>Making a commit and pushing changes to Github</h3>
       <p>
         At this point, I'll walk you through a simple workflow suitable for solo projects. Once you master this,
         you can choose a slightly more elaborate workflow that will allow you to collaborate on shared repositories
         and take advantage of the full spectrum of git's capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
         With the repository on your computer, you can start coding. When you finish making changes,
         it's time to commit them to the remote repository. Type <code class="bash">git add .</code> with
         the terminal open in the project directory. This
         collects all modified files for the commit. Next, type <code class="bash">git commit -m "descriptive message"</code>.
         This message is important because it explains to your future self and your collaborators what modifications
         you made to the project. Lastly, type <code class="bash">git push origin master</code>. This will push your
         changes up to Github's cloud server.
       </p>
       <img alt="git commit demo animation" src="git-commit.gif" />
       <h3>Next steps</h3>
       <p>
         Once you're looking to get in a regular rhythm for your git coding projects, try finding a nice workflow.
         A typical git workflow uses <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">forking</a>, 
         <a href="https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches">branches</a>, 
         <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">tags</a>, and 
         <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull requests</a>. 
         The director of curriculum at MB has a great 
         <a href="https://gist.github.com/juemura/f91ecd2b2e0ed8a77a84d25cdbe105ea">suggested workflow outline</a> 
         which you can utilize, and is an expansion on the simplistic version I've offered here.
       </p>
         You may want to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/">add your teammates
         as collaborators</a> on your repository. This means they can edit the files directly without requiring your review.
       <p>
         As mentioned, git is an industrial strength tool, so don't worry about going too deep or
         getting everything right. If you encounter any troubles, I'm here to help you sort them out. 
         Commit often, because when you do, you can always
         rewind your project to that point in time should problems occur in the future (for example, accidentally deleting 
         your entire project). There are also plenty of resources online including
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJUJ4wbFm_A">videos like this</a> that are extremely informative.
         The best way to learn git, as with normal programming, is to play around with it a lot, looking up commands 
         and following tutorials as you go.
