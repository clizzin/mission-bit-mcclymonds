       <h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
       <p>
         This course, Introduction to Web Development, is brought to you by 
         <a href="https://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, a nonproft organization 
         based in San Francisco.
       </p>
       <p>
         The goal of this course is to learn the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">computer 
         programming</a> by working in groups
         to create a game or application using the languages of the web: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. 
         Groups will present their work on Demo Day at the end of the semester.
       </p>
       <p>
         Beyond computer science, students will develop many other life skills, such as team work 
         and peer skills, overcoming obstacles and solving problems, developing a positive growth 
         mindset, and using planning and focus to accomplish goals.

       <ul>
         <li><p>Programming is an expressive, creative act</p></li>
         <li><p>Your application can provide a worthwhile, engaging, and satisfying experience for your audience and solve real-world problems</p></li>

         <li>
           <p>
             It's multi-disciplinary; programming intersects math, art, science, business, and almost any other field
           </p>
         </li>
         <li><p>You'll get under the hood of technology you already use daily and appreciate it on a deeper level</p></li>

       <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
       <p>
         This course assumes no prior knowledge other than internet browsing/computer/keyboard skills,
         the ability to follow detailed instructions, and the ability to apply logic to solve problems 
         individually and collaboratively.
       </p>
       <p>
         If you have a language barrier or special needs learning accommodation, please notify the instructor 
         right away so we can take care of your needs.
       </p>
       <hr>
       <h2 id="how-this-course-works">How this course works</h2>
       <p>
         The course is 12 weeks long with four hours of in-class time per week. 12 weeks sounds like a lot of time, 
         but it comes down to less than 48 hours of class time to learn programming and finish a project! Needless to 
         say, one can't become a programming expert in such a small amount of time, so plan to devote time outside 
         of the class to programming in order to reinforce and expand on the foundation provided in class.
       </p>
       <p>
         The entire class is project-oriented. From the beginning, you'll be creating projects of your own choosing (within the bounds
         of the instructor's approval). This approach is called 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning">experiential learning</a>, or learning by doing. 
         I will work to facilitate groups, ensuring that students are engaging the content and their classmates effectively. 
         I will offer lectures when necessary to clear up points of confusion, explain general concepts, and keep the class moving forward.
         There will be a teacher's assistant, adult mentors, volunteers and other Mission Bit staff present to assist in students' learning experience.
       </p>
       <p>
         The entire session is group-based.
         I do realize group work can be challenging; however, working in groups is an essential
         part of life and is particularly important in the programming world, so let's dive right 
         in, get comfortable with it, and make it fun!
       </p>
       <p>
         The language concepts are presented in modules. Modules offer one route to acquiring
         programming basics. Each module's content
         is roughly a class period, but because students learn at their own pace, students should feel welcome to 
         spend more or less time on a module as necessary. However, although the first few weeks may appear simple,
         the material will quickly become challenging, so I recommend setting a brisk pace from
         the start to leave ample room to absorb the later, more complicated, modules.
       </p>
       <p>
         If the material in the modules isn't appealing to you, that's OK, I can help guide you to resources that will
         teach you programming applicable to the project you want to make. The important thing is you're learning web development
         and able to demonstrate your knowledge through projects.
       </p>
       <p>
         Lastly, if you have non-HTML/JS/CSS-related topics you'd like to discuss, including questions about other 
         programming languages, hardware, computer history, machine learning, and so on, please find me before, 
         after class, or via email and I'll be happy to chat. These topics are often theoretical, fascinating and deep, 
         and can easily consume a significant chunk of class time.
       <hr>
       <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
       <h3>Absences and lateness</h3>   
       <p>
         A doctor's note or parental permission will be required for absences and tardies. The first unexcused absence or tardy
         will result in a warning; the second will result in a phone call to a parent or guardian; the third will result in the 
         removal of the student from the class.
       </p>
       <p>
         When a student is absent, even if the absence is excused, it can be very easy to fall behind. Absent students are expected 
         to follow up with the instructor and group to make up missed content.
       </p>
       <h3>Participation</h3>
       <p>
         Being physically but not mentally present in class (e.g. asleep, disengaged, unresponsive) will result in an absence.
       </p>
       <h3>Food and drinks</h3>
       <p>
         Food and drinks are allowed, with the caveat that students exercise due respect for others' space, 
         dietary and allergy considerations. Students must clean up after themselves and keep their laptop in the condition
         it was provided.
       </p>
       <h3>Use of the facility</h3>
       <p>
         Show respect for the facility which McClymonds HS has generously provided us. Do not touch any technology in the space without permission
         or roughhouse. Damage due to neglect will be paid for by the student.
       </p>
       <p>
         Bathrooms are accessible to the class and students may use them without asking. A brief mention should be made to the instructor
         when departing so students' whereabouts are known.
       </p>
       <h3>Classroom culture</h3>
       <p>
         All participants must work to ensure that everyone in class feels safe, comfortable and welcome. 
         This class encourages freedom of expression and creativity, 
         but sometimes in that process, misunderstandings can happen and feelings can be hurt.
         The class community will work together to resolve issues should they arise 
         and strive to be respectful and inclusive in their actions, words and creations.

       <ul>
         <li>
           <p>
             <b>Be present</b>. 
             Being present is the single factor that most determines success. A large amount of content will be covered 
             in each class. Missing even one or two sessions or arriving consistently late will seriously impact your outcome, and are
             behavior patterns that are grounds for termination in the professional world you're preparing to enter.
             If you have any concerns about attendance, bring them to the instructor's attention today and we'll discuss 
             strategies to manage the situation.
           </p> 
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>
             <b>Focus</b> is the key to learning stuff, whatever it may be. We all struggle with constant distractions from 
             games, texting, Snapchat, etc. These things seem fun in the short run, 
             but in the long run, the folks who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlearning">get great</a> 
             at something make time to focus on the activities they truly want to define their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
             Getting into and maintaining
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> is an integral part of learning.
             My goal is to identify and eliminate obstacles between students and their flow state. Let me know how I can help you!

           <blockquote>
             To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the 
             social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. 
             To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to 
             find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.

             Phones and software products compete for control over your focus and time, and have developed clever ways of doing so.

             <a href="http://www.tristanharris.com/">Google's Design Ethicist</a>, 
             might offer interesting insight. I'm not saying technology is bad, but it's important to
             understand your relationship to it, assess to what extent it's moving you towards your life goals and adjust 
             your habits accordingly.

             <b>Don't worry</b> if you get confused, frustrated, or stuck on a problem. These are completely normal 
             parts of the learning process; embracing these situations is what learning is all about.
           </p>
           <p>
             When I work with primary school students, they tend to leap into coding. They don't
             mind if they make mistakes along the way. Older students,
             in contrast, are often worried about failing and may disengage. 
             Approaching experiences with an eager, open attitude and without preconceptions is called 
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">shoshin</a> in Zen Buddhism, and it may be a helpful concept
             throughout your learning journey.

             <b>Ask questions</b>, especially when stuck. By asking questions, one is taking 
             agency over learning, engaging in curiosity, and building 
             <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve">growth mindset</a>. 
             Some students are afraid of asking questions for a variety of reasons. If you don't ask questions,
             it's worth asking yourself why!
